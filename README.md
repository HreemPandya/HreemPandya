## üëã Who am I?

Hi! I‚Äôm Hreem Pandya, a computer engineering student who loves creating things that inspire change and make life a little easier‚Äîeven if it‚Äôs just for small groups of people. I‚Äôm passionate about blending hardware and software to build impactful, efficient, and scalable solutions.  

I build fast, ship faster, and enjoy turning ideas into reality that improve convenience and accessibility for others. Whether it‚Äôs embedded systems, secure communication, or automation, I‚Äôm driven by the potential of technology to solve real-world problems and excited to keep growing through hands-on, collaborative projects.

## üíª Experiences

- Created **FridgeMind (Hackathon Winner)** --> a Raspberry Pi + QNX system with a YOLOv5 model trained on 300+ images to detect fridge items and a cross-platform app that suggests recipes using the Gemini LLM API
- Developed **ML-based drone landing detection with YOLOv8** and fine-tuned autonomous navigation algorithms as part of WARG, ensuring reliable precision in real-time flight environments  
- Architected a **grocery flyer data pipeline** at Skrimp.ai using Python, TypeScript, and Claude API with **95% accuracy**, and built a React + Node.js store discovery tool with geolocation support    
- Designed **GestureGroove**, a gesture-controlled Spotify player with React + TypeScript and MediaPipe, achieving **90%+ recognition accuracy** for hands-free music interaction  
- Built **BeMyEyes**, an Arduino-powered wearable with ultrasonic sensors and Google TTS, providing real-time spatial alerts and visual descriptions for the visually impaired  
- Collaborated on **OreCast**, an AI-driven geological prediction system with TensorFlow + Scikit-learn, including anomaly detection models and CI/CD validation for accuracy  
- Led workshops on **Raspberry Pi, hosted hackathons**, and taught programming fundamentals to a 40+ member student club, fostering collaborative learning and hands-on technical growth
